## About This Repository

Welcome to my Git repository containing a master bib file with citation information for hundreds of sources in American politics. This bibliography includes a broad range of works relevant to the study of political institutions, electoral behavior, public opinion, policymaking, and legislative dynamics.

I should note that the bib file is far from clean—it includes some repeated entries and inconsistencies, but it is comprehensive and serves as a working resource for compiling citations efficiently. If you’re using this file, be prepared to do some manual cleaning.

Additionally, this repository includes a PDF guide for students preparing for Ph.D. comprehensive exams in American politics. This document provides detailed briefing memos on key political science texts, organized thematically across several major subfields.

## About the Guide

The American Politics Comprehensive Exam Study Bible is a set of study notes that I compiled to assist in preparation for Ph.D. exams in American politics. The guide is structured around major thematic areas, such as: public opinion and political attitudes, voting behavior and participation, partisanship and polarization, campaigns and elections, interest groups and lobbying, Congress, the presidency, and the courts, and policy and federalism

Each section provides detailed summaries of key works, including discussions of theory, methods, findings, and important quotations. While the guide is not a substitute for reading the original literature, it serves as a useful supplement for organizing and reviewing major debates in the field.

The guide reflects my experience as a Ph.D. student at the University of South Carolina in the mid-2020s, and while it is predominantly behavioral in focus, it covers a wide range of perspectives. The structure follows course syllabi from American Politics graduate seminars, and the materials may not be exhaustive, but they include many foundational texts.

I encourage you to verify any quotations against the original sources before using them in your own work.

How to use this repository: (1) The bib file can be imported into any reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Endnote, Mendeley, BibTeX) for easy citation tracking. (2) The PDF guide provides a structured overview of the field and serves as a reference tool for students preparing for exams or conducting research in American politics.

## Contributing and Cleaning the Bib File
